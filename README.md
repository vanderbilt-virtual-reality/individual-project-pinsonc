# Set Visualization for Vanderbilt Off-Broadway's Production of Into the Woods
## Conner Pinson | Individual Project for CS3892
a) Why did	you	make	this? Your intention or	motivation

I am currently a cast member in Vanderbilt Off-Broadway's (VOB) production of *Into the Woods* by Stephen Sondheim. I am close to the artistic and technical directors and they expressed their frustration that, due to the lack of permanent space on Vanderbilt's campus, it was impossible to view their set design until the week of the show.

b) Why is VR a	good medium to achieve your goals?

c) Critiques or	limitations	of VR	for	your goals?	(optional)
