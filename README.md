# Set Visualization for Vanderbilt Off-Broadway's Production of Into the Woods
## Conner Pinson | Individual Project for CS3892

This project was built on **Unity 2019.2.0f1**

**a) Why did you make this? Your intention or	motivation**

I am currently a cast member in Vanderbilt Off-Broadway's (VOB) production of *Into the Woods* by Stephen Sondheim. I am close to the artistic and technical directors and they expressed their frustration that, due to the lack of permanent space on Vanderbilt's campus, it was impossible to view their set design until the week of the show.

So I offered this solution, we could mock up their set design in Unity and explore it in VR. We can also allow the designers to move furniture freely to determine the final design for the set. This will offer several advantages over traditional set modeling software like VectorWorks.

In my approach, I modeled the venue, Ingram Hall, as closely as I could to the real thing. This includes the scale and features such as curtains, lighting and the orchestra "cover" (the large wooden door that covers the stage when the whole thing is not in use that gets folded to the side during VOB shows). Then I included the furniture for the initial design of the top of the show's set in the design given to me. Unfortunately, I don't have the modeling skills to make the exact furniture we will be using for the show, but I have substituted them with comparable replacements from the Victorian Interiors Asset pack.

My hope is that this application will span past just being a project for this class and will lead to me being able to model the rest of the scenes in the show for the directors to explore ahead of time.

**b) Why is VR a good medium to achieve your goals?**

I believe this is one of the primary reasons VR exists: it is allowing us to explore spaces we don't have the physical capacity to recreate or travel to ourselves. 

Due to limited funds, VOB cannot be in the production space for any more than 4 days before we have our opening night. So being able to see the space beforehand could be game-chainging for the set design process.
